      <div class="text-muted">
        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="px-2">Each home is provided enough home garden space to allow for food &
          herb production. The design using mostly the single attached model, or duplex model, provides savings on the
          shared wall construction, while allowing for a more spacious community. This also allows for a reduced
          concrete footprint over the entire land to allow for rain water seepage for the replenishment of the ground
          water, while also allowing more of the garden to be reached by the sun.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="px-2">The village is designed to allow for common parks and playgrounds
          to be used for "food gardens." This is done by distributing its parks and playgrounds into garden 'greenways'
          behind each home, such that it also serves as a social interaction spaces for kids and adults, as well as an
          additional corridor space for the community and home owners, ultimately creating a less dense development.</p>

    <p class="px-2">These parks and playgrounds are also constantly irrigated by gray water used by each house, thereby
      continuously
      irrigating these common areas, while the homes are being lived in. These 'greenways' will also be provided with
      vermicompost bins, where daily organic trash (such as paper products, fruit peelings and the like) can be fed to
      earthworms to produce vermicast, which is an organic fertilizer for the agricultural use of the community.
      Backyard
      vermiculture allows organic farming for food and herbs. As some herbs and plants are medicinal in nature, this
      allows for venues for reduction in the costs of medical care for the home owners. Not only does the village reduce
      food costs, medicinal costs and the waste production of the community, it also reduces energy requirement for
      waste
      management, and trains the community for a more healthy living.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="px-2">The village also encourages water resource preservation by providing the option for rain water tanks
      for each home,
      which will be used for the irrigation of the farm-garden areas. Sidewalks and catch basins along the roads of the
      subdivisions are also designed to be porous, to allow water to seep through the soil to replenish the water table.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="px-2">Model houses are designed to accommodate different variations on how the garden of each home can be.
      Each household
      has the option to use vertical herbal gardens, aquaponics tanks, chicken or rabbit cages for the backyard, and
      vegetable patches for each home depending on their preference.</p>
    <p class="px-2">These elements of the homes are designed to reduce household expenditures of each home owner, which aptly suits
      the
      needs of our target market for affordable housing. Homes are also designed to provide for a car port for each
      house,
      to provide for the future growth of the homeowners, thereby ensuring the long term flexibility of each home
      design.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="px-2">The houses are designed to have reduced energy requirements. Each house is designed such that wind
      can naturally
      ventilate the houses efficiently. High windows allow for hot air to be released immediately out of each home.
      These
      windows also allow natural sunlight to come into each home to bring light and disinfect the homes daily.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="px-2">Vicmar Homes is an integrated and sustainable concept for affordable housing. It will be an
      environmentally
      conscious, financially conscious, and health conscious development.</p>
